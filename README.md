# CSC 215 â€” DS Extra Credit 1

Inside the source folder is the `Student` class that we designed together in our discussion session, along with
the `Course` and `Name` class.

`CSStudent` is a child of `Student`, containing one extra field, `favoriteLanguages`.

## Instructions

The provided main method has an instance of `CSStudent` and `Student` created for you.

Only update **two methods**. Nothing else.

### First, update `getUnits()` in `Student` (2 points)

Update this method to calculate the number of units based on the classes they're taking.

> 1 point for attempt. 2 points for correct implementation.

### Second, update `printStudent()` in `Main` (3 points)

The method already prints out the student's name and the courses they're taking. Update this method so that it prints
the student's favorite language if they are a `CSStudent`.

> 1 point for attempt. 3 points for correct implementation.

When complete, you should see the following as the output:

```

MATH 225   Units:  3
ANTH 100   Units:  3
